## Rationale

The web we know is crammed with _valuable_ and _insightful_ information. Yet we frequently struggle to ask the _right questions_ as we drown in this rich and varied sea of possibilities. Too often the potential of technology is overlooked as it is considered '__complex__' or '__time-consuming__'.

Even the most diligent of us are also _guilty_ of glancing at tutorials, articles and examples without actually reading them. A 'search-first' world has dented our capacity to really pay attention to the written word, reducing our own 'information seeking' habits to merely skimming and discarding when gratification is not immediately forthcoming.

This site is an attempt to swim against this tide, by sharing guidance and thoughts on what has become commonly known as 'cloud' technologies. The article format, with a focus on _words_ and _explanations_ rather than screenshots and step-by-step instructions, is aimed at encouraging _thinking_ & _understanding_.

###### Why the name?

In computer science, a stack has a particular [technical meaning][18]. More recently, it has begun to be used as shorthand for a _development_ or _solution_ [stack][19]. In these technological terms, it describes a group of applications, or services, which come together to build a platform for work. The tools you use every day to get your job done, to function fully in a connected world. This site is all about those tools, how they can work smoothly together and how you can use them better. In short, it's about the __stacks__ upon which we build our _technological lives_.

### Content

{% if site.posts.first %}Most recent published content: __[{{ site.posts.first.date | date_to_string }} - {{ site.posts.first.title }}]({{site.posts.first.url}})__{% endif %}

All the content for this site is original work, the culmination of work and experience with a wide range of technologies. Everything is authored in a simple text-based language called [Markdown][1], which was originally proposed and design by [Jon Gruber][2]. It is a simple format that allows for a clean separation of these words from their style and presentation on your screen. Like technology itself, all [posts][3] on this site should be considered as '_work in progress_' and are available online (under an open-source license - see below) for amendment by anyone who would like to propose changes or improvements.

To do this you will need a free [Github](https://github.com/, "Github Homepage") account. Once you have an account, you can click on the small Github Logo (the [octocat][4]) at the bottom right of each post which will take you directly to the source of the article on Github. From here, you can edit your own version of the article (part of what is known as a [fork][5]) by clicking on the small pencil/edit icon near the top of the page. Once you have completed your edit, you can ask that your change be _merged_ into the __[live]({{ site.url }})__ version of this site by creating a _pull request_ (or, more simply, a request that your changed be 'pulled' into the live version of this site). If you supply a reason with your request, and your request is accepted, your change will be published and the article will be __updated__.

###### Taxonomy

All the posted content on this site is both categorised & tagged: this is the '_structure_' or [taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(general)){:target="_blank"} of the site. The categories (articles, tutorials, links etc.) reflect the _type_ of content. The tags refer to subjects covered by the content. You can easily __navigate__ by either category (using the navigation menu or links at the top of each post) or from the [tags](/tags) page.

### Design

Current version: __{{ site.version }}__. A [test](/test){:target="_blank"} page is provided to illustrate the different types of formatting used across the site.

###### Typography

The [typefaces][6] for this site are open-source and are served from [Google Fonts][7]. They have been selected to deliver a timeless aesthetic, aid readability, encourage focus & help concentration. The page & post titles are set in [Baumans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baumans) (as is the lifestack logo), headings are in [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and the body is in [Alegreya](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya) (an award winning & highly readable typeface from [Huerta Tipogr√°fica](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya-libre). Text emphasis is provided by __bolds__ and _italics_, with clickable link denoted by small CAPITALISATION (rather than the normal yet inelegant underlining). Abbreviations, such as HTML, are set in a lighter-colored bold and will display their meaning if you hover over them.

###### Colours

A simple _three-layer_ scheme is used throughout the site, with deep blacks & greys for the _main content_, lighter greys for background _information_ or_icons_. A __bold__ red highlight is used for _links_, _titles_ and the _navigation menu_. As above, this simplicity is a deliberate design decision to help focus attention on the __words__ themselves. Keyboard shortcuts, such as *ctrl-v*{:.kb-shortcut} are memorably emphasised with a dark background and extra spacing to help them stick in the mind, to hopefully save you time in the future.

###### Layout

The layout of the site is build around a __content column__, restricted to a maximum [line-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length) to ensure _readability_ whilst also making the most of larger screens. A left-hand column & wide spacing-gutter is home to explanatory notes and used for header links to help structure and navigate longer posts. On smaller screen devices (e.g. mobiles), this column will fold into a _single-column design_ taking up the full width of the screen. Navigation is provided by a 'fly-out' navigation __menu__ that remains normally hidden to reduce visual clutter and distraction.

###### Logo

Like the titles, our logo is set in [Baumans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baumans). It has been conceived as a [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) inspired play on the notion of a 'stack'. Bold, memorable and striking, it hopefully conveys modernity and modernisim without falling back on the well-worn imagery of the 'technology' industry.

###### Illustration

Illustrations, rather than screenshots or photos, are used to illustrate individual posts. These help ensure a consistent _style_ and also don't age as quickly as screenshots (for the exact design of web-applications changes frequently). For this reason, and to ensure longevity of utility, actions tend to be _described_ (e.g. submit the registration form) rather than _narrated_ (e.g. click on the large blue button entitled 'submit' at the bottom left hand side of the form).

### Architecture & Process

This site is a [static][8] website, meaning __no__ _server-side code_ runs when you request each page. This makes it _easier_ to author, manage and host. It should also be _faster_ to load. When the site content or design is changed in anyway, the whole site is re-generated using a tool called [Jekyll][9] which runs on a programming language called [Ruby][10]. Jekyll helps _manage_ index pages and _merge_ the files containing text content with the style & layout of the site (authored in standard HTML and [SASS][11]). The static HTML content is compressed to help ensure it is delivered as [quickly & efficiently][12] as possible. All the content & styling is authored using [Codeanywhere][13] or Google Docs and the [Gabriel][14] add-on to convert the document to markdown and publish it.

### Copyright & Licensing

To help you use the content on this site in _useful ways_, everything is _[open-source][17]_, and here is a summary of how the site is __licensed__.
